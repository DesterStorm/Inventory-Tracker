Ruby on Rails api JavaScript frontend Portfolio Project 

Inventory-Tracker

Introduction:

This is a personal tool for keeping track of the things you have and where you keep them. It uses the Rails framework as an api and JavaScript as the frontend. The application uses postgresql for the database to store items you'd like to track and the categories those items fall under.

Running the app:

1. fork and clone this repo.

2. cd to the inventory-api directory from the terminal

3. in the terminal, run bundle install to install all required gems

4. run the command "rails s" to start the app server

5. copy the absolute path of the index.html file in Inventory-Tracker and paste it into the browser.

Start by filling out the form and add a new category to start adding items you'd like to track into the categories you create.
